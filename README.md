Diabetes Prediction â€“ Multi-Class Classification Project
Overview
This project was developed as part of an academic assignment while pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science and Analytics at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM). The aim was to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the stage of diabetes (across 13 distinct classes) based on various health indicators.

Author
This project was solely developed by Duaa Khalid Albedewi. All aspects of the workâ€”including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizationâ€”were completed independently as part of my continuous learning journey in applied machine learning.

Purpose
The key objectives of this project are to:

Gain hands-on experience in multi-class classification problems

Apply techniques in data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection

Improve understanding of performance metrics for multi-class models

Practice end-to-end machine learning pipeline development

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle and can be accessed here:
